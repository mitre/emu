# CALDERA plugin: Emu

A plugin supplying CALDERA with TTPs from the Center for Threat Informed Defense Adversary Emulation Plans.

Each emulation plan will have an adversary and a set of facts. Please ensure to select the related facts to the 
adversary when starting an operation. Some adversaries may require additional payloads and executables to be 
downloaded. Run the `download_payloads.sh` script to download these binaries to the `payloads` directory.
